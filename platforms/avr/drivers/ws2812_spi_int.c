/* This is an interrupt-driven SPI driver for the
 * WS2812/SK6812 RGB leds, for the ATmega32U.
 *
 * It sets SPI to 8MHz and sends 11100000 for a zero
 * and 11111110 for a one. The time used by the ISR
 * to prepare the next bit ensures the timming after
 * each bit.
 *
 * It requires a 16MHz CPU clock and the pins PB0 and PB1
 * unused (they are part of the ISP interface, so it's not
 * uncommon), and the leds connected to the PB2 pin. Also,
 * it can manage a maximum of 85 leds.
 *
 * It uses 40 bytes more than the WS2812 driver, but being interrupt
 * based, allows to multiplex the LEDs with other tasks.
